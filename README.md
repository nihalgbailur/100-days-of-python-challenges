# 10 Days of Python Challenges

Welcome to my "100 Days of Python Challenges" repository! This project is a personal coding journey where I'll be taking on a 100-day challenge of daily Python programming exercises and projects.

## About the Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to improve my Python programming skills and explore various Python concepts through a series of small and engaging projects. Each day, I'll be working on a new Python challenge, tackling everything from basic algorithms and data structures to more complex applications.

## Table of Contents

- [Day 1](./Day1): Simple Calculator
- [Day 2](./Day2): ...

Each day's challenge will be organized in a separate folder (e.g., Day 1, Day 2, ...) with a corresponding Python script, a README explaining the challenge, and any necessary resources.

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to explore the challenges in this repository, follow my progress, and even join the journey yourself! You can clone this repository to your local machine, and each day's challenge will be in a separate folder, making it easy to navigate and understand.

## Contributing

Although this is a personal challenge repository, I'm always open to suggestions, improvements, and collaboration. If you have an interesting Python challenge idea or spot an issue with any of the challenges, feel free to create a pull request or open an issue.


Let's embark on this Python journey together and become better programmers one challenge at a time!

Happy coding! üêç
