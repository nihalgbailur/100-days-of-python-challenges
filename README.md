# 100 Days of Python Challenges

Welcome to my "100 Days of Python Challenges" repository! This project is a personal coding journey where I'll be taking on a 100-day challenge of daily Python programming exercises and projects.

## About the Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to improve my Python programming skills and explore various Python concepts through a series of small and engaging projects. Each day, I'll be working on a new Python challenge, tackling everything from basic algorithms and data structures to more complex applications.

## Challenge Progress

Below is a table showing each day's challenge along with a link to the solution folder and the completion status.

## Progress Tracker

Use `progress_tracker.py` to record which days you've completed. Run the script with a day number to mark it as finished:

```bash
python progress_tracker.py 1
```

Running the script without arguments shows your overall progress.
